# OpenGL-Morphing
 Simple game where the user is give a shape and must recreate it, trying to get as close as possible to the orignal
 
 This game was made using C++ with GLUT for my Graphics 1 module at the University Of Northamtpon, of which the breif was to creat an application that morphs between two shapes using linear interpolation, i have taken this a tad further and decided to create a game based around the concept
